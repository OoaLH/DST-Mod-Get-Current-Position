# DST Mod Get Current Position
The minimalist mod to help novices find each other in the *don't starve together* world using a *get position* button to get current coordinates without further map mods.

*find touchstone* button returns the coordinates of the nearest touchstone and the character will turn its face to it.



To use the mod, put the **DST-Mod-Get-Current-Position** folder under **common/Don't Starve Together/mods/**. In macOS it would be **steamapps/common/Don't Starve Together/dontstarve_steam/Contents/mods**.

Icons and other features wil be updated.
